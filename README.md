Mega Picker iOS App
===================
by Carl Gorringe <car1@gorringe.org>

This is a simple app that randomly generates lotto numbers specifically for the Mega Millions lottery.

[![Available on the AppStore](app_store_badge.jpg)](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id803877750)

This App was created as part of a class that I taught in iOS development at the California College of the Arts in San Francisco, in the Spring of 2012.

Lecture notes are provided in the lesson_notes txt files.  The app was originally written for iOS 5.  It has been updated to deploy on iOS 7.
